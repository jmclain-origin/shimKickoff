## How to use

OS Requirements.
- Java 1.8
- Maven 
- Tomcat 8.5

### Run it yourself
Project setting should preload with intelliJ. If not my require a couple of changes, I'll assume you have the basic knowledge on how to do that.
Simple set up, use Tomcat to serve static files. Before you launch Tomcat you need to generate the `.war` file. Execute command.

```bash
$ mvn clean && mvn install && mvn package
```

### Frontend UI only

Grab the webpage content only. You'll need to get...
1. the markup file @ [`/src/main/webapp/index.jsp`](./src/main/webapp/index.jsp)
2. styling and functionality @ [`/src/main/webapp/dist`](./src/main/webapp/dist) *whole folder - contains CSS and JS*
3. additional resources @ [`/src/main/webapp/public`](./src/main/webapp/public) *whole folder - contains images referenced in web page*

Note: Keep the sources ing the same root directory and nested file tree, else make edit to the new paths.

## Flow Demo
